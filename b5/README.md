1. This folder is derived from https://github.com/Alheimsins/b5-johnson-120-ipip-neo-pi-r.
   Normally you would just install and import the module, but the original index.js file has variables in its CommonJS require statements, and this doesn't work with Parcel, so I had to make some small changes.

2. I only included the English data for now.
