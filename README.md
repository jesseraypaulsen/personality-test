1. remove items from the top bar
2. create a new menu icon.
3. topbar will have two menu icons on the left, title on the right.
4. insert the removed items from #1, into a new menu that will be accessed by an icon on the left of the topbar, along with the inventory icon. The four items to be moved are: Results, Auto-Step, Info, and Generate random data. The new menu will be similar to the Inventory Menu, but wayyy shorter.
5. The goal here is overall changes toward mobile-friendly. So the new menu will follow the template of the inventory menu. On desktop it fills the left third of the screen, but on mobile it should take up the whole screen.
6. Add stuff to the Results Dashboard -- it is anemic right now. Maybe create a feature on the dashboard for saving your results in localStorage, and then switching them out in UI, but retaining the ability to switch back to your saved results. Currently the "generate data" button destroys your results. We could move the "generate data" button onto the dashboard itself instead of into the new menu. So the new menu would only have 3 options, one of which is the dashboard.
7. deploy demo on cloud
