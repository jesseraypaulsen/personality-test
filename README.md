## Todos

**_The overall goal is mobile-friendly._**

- Results Dashboard
  - media query for mobile wrt BarChart
  - modal intro with prompt for profile name, but if the user is returning from a prior session they have a different version of the modal that says "welcome so-and-so -- if this is the wrong profile change it in the dashboard." https://mui.com/material-ui/react-dialog/#form-dialogs
  - accordion on the Dashboard, for hiding/showing all users with buttons for switching to, or deleting.
  - dashboard -> between header and barchart, there's an arrow or something that you click to expand and see all users.

---

- Someday/Maybe: change top bar to a small partial sidebar that expands/collapses at the press of a button.
